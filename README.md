## Problem Statement
Q1 (Food Waste) In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste. How can we tackle this growing problem and encourage Singaporeans to cut down on unnecessary food waste?

## What does your app do?
FoodBoss is a seamless AI-powered Expiry Date Tracker for the consumer, in collaboration with supermarkets, offering solutions to existing problems:
- Quick detection of expiry dates with AI, over time-consuming manual key-in of expiry dates
- Easy to use app allows for easy adoption for the public and supermarkets

# How does your hack answer the problem statement?
- Food waste is caused by people overbuying and not using up food before expiry
### Features of this app which address this problem:
- Easy tracking of food about to expire soon
- Reminders about soon-expiring food so user consumes them in time
- Automatic adding of food items with expiry dates to app, with aid of cashier/e-payment system whenever user goes shopping, making it convenient to track expiry dates
- Backup manual key-in of food items, in cases when:
-- Food items are purchased outside of partner supermarkets
-- Barcode or Expiry Date reader malfunctions/is inaccurate
