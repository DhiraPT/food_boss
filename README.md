## Problem Statement
Q1 (Food Waste) In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food waste. How can we tackle this growing problem and encourage Singaporeans to cut down on unnecessary food waste?

## What does your app do?
FoodBoss is a seamless AI-powered Expiry Date Tracker for the consumer, in collaboration with supermarkets, offering solutions to existing problems:
- Quick detection of expiry dates with AI, over time-consuming manual key-in of expiry dates
- Easy to use app allows for easy adoption for the public and supermarkets

### Process of use:
1. Barcode of item bought is scanned by cashier or E-payment system
2. Customer opens their FoodBoss app and shows their Account QR
3. Supermarket iPad scans
-- Account QR of customer (with FoodBoss app)
-- Barcode of each item (with Supermarket’s barcode reader)
-- Expiry date of each item (with Text Reader AI of FoodBoss app)
4. After Payment, information of each item added to User’s FoodBoss app are:
-- Item Name
